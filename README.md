# MySQL Project – Dataset of Electronic Items

This project demonstrates SQL expertise through the design, implementation, and analysis of an electronic product database using MySQL. It showcases how structured data can be used to uncover trends, optimize inventory, and derive actionable insights.

## 📁 Project Overview

The project uses a dataset of electronic items including attributes such as:

- Item name
- Category
- Price
- Stock availability
- Supplier details
- Rating
- User-item interactions
- Year of release

## 📌 Key Features

- ✅ Designed and implemented a normalized MySQL database schema for electronics data.
- 🔎 Performed complex SQL queries including joins, subqueries, groupings, and aggregate functions.
- 📊 Analyzed inventory trends and user behavior based on product categories, years, and model attributes.

## 🧠 Sample Queries

- Retrieve all products from the `electronics` table.
- Get all products with model attribute as `Female`.
- Sort products by rating (ascending or descending).
- Identify products without a specified brand.
- Count and group products by year or category.
- Filter categories starting with a specific letter (e.g., 'C').
- View top-rated products and find those with shared model attributes.
- Use stored procedures and functions for specific business logic.

## 🧰 Advanced SQL Techniques

- **Stored Procedures**: e.g., fetch items from "Camera & Photo" category.
- **Functions**: e.g., count products released in a given year.
- **Views**: created to display simplified subsets like `item_id`, `user_id`, and `rating`.
